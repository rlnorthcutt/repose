# Go Comments or Go Home
## You should write comments
Comments are meant for developers to document and explain their code; they are not executable code and do not affect the program's runtime behavior. 

When the Go compiler (or any compiler, for that matter) translates your source code into an executable binary, it disregards comments. The resulting binary contains only the machine code necessary to run the program, without any of the human-readable comments that were present in the source code.

This behavior has a couple of implications:

1. **Performance**: Comments have no impact on the performance of the compiled program. Since they are not included in the final binary, they don't consume any memory or processing power during execution.

2. **Code Readability and Maintenance**: While comments don't affect the execution of a program, they are crucial for making the source code understandable and maintainable. Good comments can greatly aid in the development process, especially when working in teams or returning to your own code after a long time.

3. **Documentation Tools**: Some languages and tools use specially formatted comments to generate documentation (like Javadoc in Java). While Go does not have an official tool like Javadoc, the community often uses tools like `godoc` to generate documentation from comments, especially those written in a specific format.

In summary, while comments are essential for understanding and maintaining code, they are not part of the compiled executable and have no impact on the program's runtime.
