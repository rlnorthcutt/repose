in Go, do I have to define a public struct if I want to pass it between methods, or can I use make() to define it inside one method and then return it to another

In Go, you do not necessarily have to define a public struct to pass it between methods; you can define and use structs locally within a function or method, and return them just as you would with any other data type. However, the visibility (public vs. private) of a struct and its fields, determined by the capitalization of the first letter of their names, affects where they can be accessed from.

### Using a Locally Defined Struct

You can define a struct within a function, instantiate it, and return it without using `make()`. The `make()` function in Go is used for slices, maps, and channels, but not for structs. Instead, you use a composite literal to instantiate structs. Here's an example:

```go
func createLocalStruct() myStruct {
    // Define a struct locally
    type localStruct struct {
        Name string
        Age  int
    }

    // Instantiate the struct
    ls := localStruct{
        Name: "John Doe",
        Age: 30,
    }

    return ls
}
```

This function defines a struct `localStruct`, instantiates it, and returns an instance of it. However, this code will not compile as is because the return type `myStruct` is not defined. If you intend to return a locally defined struct, the function signature should match the local struct type:

```go
func createLocalStruct() localStruct {
    // Function body remains the same...
}
```

### Returning Structs to Other Methods

If you want to return a struct from a function and use it in another part of your program, you have two main options:

1. **Define the struct at the package level**: This is the most common approach, especially if the struct represents a significant part of your program's data model or if it needs to be accessed from multiple places.

2. **Use interface{}**: If you define a struct locally within a function and want to return it to a caller that doesn't know the struct's type ahead of time, you can return it as an `interface{}`. However, the caller will need to use type assertions or type switches to work with the actual data, which is less type-safe and generally not recommended without a good reason.

### Example with Package-level Struct

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Define the struct at the package level
type MyStruct struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

// Function that instantiates and returns the struct
func createMyStruct() MyStruct {
    return MyStruct{
        Name: "Jane Doe",
        Age: 28,
    }
}

func main() {
    ms := createMyStruct()
    fmt.Println(ms)
}
```

This approach is more straightforward and type-safe, making it easier to maintain and understand your code. It's generally recommended to define structs at the package level if they are used across multiple functions or methods.
